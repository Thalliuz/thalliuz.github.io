          <p><h3>What makes this website and others good in my</br> opinion is that you are able to keep everything </br>proportionally organized between each other. </h3>

              <ul>
                <li>Something I noticed about this website Div and ul are used heavily</li>
                <li>Not sure what date-track-event maybe it is able to track how long something like an article has been around</li>
                <li>Class element is another one I am not sure about. I believe that it is used to help keep organized</li>
                <li>Script Tag is probably for javascript or other  code to be placed inside of the html</li>
